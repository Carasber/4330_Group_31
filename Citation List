"Use of Artificial Intelligence (Ai) Tools 

Within this course, you are welcome to use generative artificial intelligence (Ai) models (ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, and anything
after) with acknowledgment. However, you should note that all large language models have a tendency to make up incorrect facts
produce non-functional code and fake citations, they may perpetuate biases, and image generation models can occasionally come up
with offensive products. You will be responsible for any inaccurate, biased, offensive, or otherwise unethical content you
submit regardless of whether it originally comes from you or an Ai model.

If you use an Ai model, its contribution must be cited and discussed:
• What was your prompt?
• Did you revise the Ai model’s original output for your submission?
• Did you ask follow-up questions?
• What did you learn?

Having said all these disclaimers, the use of Ai models is encouraged, as it may make it possible for you to submit assignments
and your work in the field with higher quality and in less time"



+++++ Upload Picture Section +++++

• What was your prompt?

    This was the prompt that was provided-

    ex:"write a code on adding an upload a photo upload function into a vuejs file."

• Did you revise the Ai model’s original output for your submission?

    Yes, there were many issues with the original output of the AI. It seems like AI tools are not perfect.
    The following prompt was used as 'Revision' on chatGPT side. And there was revision on our side while
    trouble shooting in order to get it to function properly. Espcially when getting to know Vue.

    ex:"how do I import the component vue if the other vue is in another folder called components?"

• Did you ask follow-up questions?

    Yes, there were many follow-up questions as they either produce the same output or produced an output that was 
    'suffient' for what is required for the project. Ther follow-up question that is shown was able to output a code
    that was 'suffient' enough. More troubleshooting and fixing errors on our side was required in order to fix the 
    upload section. These follow-up questions (little by little) helped us on creating the upload button.

    ex:"How to include a clear image button"

• What did you learn?

    We learned many things, espcially working with AI tools. Given that this was the first requierment there was some 
    difficulty working with AI tools. It shows that AI tools are not without flaws as well as actully causing more trouble
    than help at times. On rare occasion it will give a 'negative' impact, so using information from other sources were 
    also useful. We also learned about file directory and how they effect the front-end since we are working with the upload
    buttton. Being able to fix the errors that AI does, has made us (as a team) better as looking at flaws as well.



+++++ Confirmation Dialog (Non-Component) +++++

• What was your prompt?

    This was the prompt that was provided-

    ex:"write a code that creates a dialog popup confirmation box to delete an event using this code on vue3."

• Did you revise the Ai model’s original output for your submission?

    Yes, there was alot of revision, it was difficult getting components to work at first (Vue was new at the time). 
    So we decided to do a non-component version and to hard-code it. There were many issues regarding this at first 
    but once we got it to work there were less isuess and we became more confident in our ability to work on thhe front-end.
    Being able to do this gave us the ability to be more confident in our work and to later implement it as a a component, this 
    was not needed as a requierment but have the ability to have function properly then later put as a component made the
    transition easier as well as giving us a more 'grounded' level on our understanding of Vue and Front-end. The revision would 
    later make the foundation for the components of the dialog box.

    ex:"Why does this code not work when clicking on the delete button? Only when clicking on the update button does the
    confirmation box show up."

• Did you ask follow-up questions?

    Yes, there were some issues relating to this as it was hard-coded and did not used components so we asked ways on how this
    would react compareto components. We wanted to ask this as we will later be asking how to create a dialog box that will 
    feature components. The follow-up questions were mostly clarifications as well as hard-coding a abit in order to get the 
    confirmation deletion box to work. There were also research outside of using ChatGPT for this occausion.

    ex: "How does this differ from components"

• What did you learn?

    There were many things that we learned, the biggest was the impact of Vue as a component compared to not having component. 
    It did give as idea on how we would like to work with components. Although, components were not implemented yet, the many 
    clarifications and extra research that was provided as well as 'practice' using Chat GBT and hard coding as been extremly 
    useful. Using ChatGPT for research and not just asking for code is extremly useful and a skill that most likely be carried 
    into the future. 



+++++ Confirmation Dialog (Component) +++++

• What was your prompt?

    This was the prompt that was provided-

    ex:"Create a vue component dialog box for a delete confirmation button."

• Did you revise the Ai model’s original output for your submission?

    Yes, technically this is a revision of an early form of the confirmation dialog. This is using components for the dialog box 
    and many revision had to be done. It was extremly helpful on our first try on create a dialog box, however this one would be 
    different and would requiere way more revisions and trouble shooting as the errors would occur between routes. The routing 
    caused many issues on using components to create the dialog box. There was a need to keep asking clarifying questions and 
    many follow up question to revise the output that was provided. The use of routing was the biggest issues that occurd.

    ex:"When clicking on the delete button, the dialog box does not pop up why might that be the case?"

• Did you ask follow-up questions?

    Yes, we asked many follow-up questions. The two main ones being 'ways on getting the code to work correctly' (not a prompt) 
    and on how 'components were affecting the fron-end' (also not a promp). After doing futher research, we found out that there 
    was an issue regarding the routing. There were alot of issues with routing since the dialog box works way different when 
    using components.

    ex:"How to properly call and import/export components into views while using router"

• What did you learn?

    We learned how components have an impact on the front-end. Especially, when working with routing in the front-end. There was 
    alot of confusion on how being able to move between pages and how pages affected each other. Being able to use components as 
    definetly gave us a better understanding on how to use routing to our advantage.



The following also helped to fixed the issues caused by AI and by trouble shooting
